* Function: find the number of connected components in a graph
* Input Format:
   * The first line contains non-negative integers n and m — the number of vertices and the number of edges respectively. 
   * The vertices are always numbered from 1 to n. 
   * Each of the following m lines defines an edge in the format u v where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n are endpoints of the edge.
* Output Format: Output the number of connected components.
